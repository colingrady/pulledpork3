[snort]
# PulledPork needs to know which version of Snort you are running in most instances.
# you can do this by giving an explict snort_version or by providing the path (snort_path)
# to the snort binary.  If you don't do either of these, PulledPork will try to determine
# the version of snort by searching for the the binary on your system path.
# This is used to know which registere ruleset to download, the correct files from the LightSPD
# ruleset, and will be used to compile .so rules if you don't provide the distro.

# Where is the Snort Executable located (if not on the system path)
# snort_path = /usr/local/bin/snort

# Which version of snort are you running (optional, not usually needed.). This version will over-rule snort_path
# snort_version=3.1.0.0

# Where is the PID file for your running snort process/daemon (required to tell snort to reload the
# new rules after rules are modified) This is optional, but recomended.
# (Not implemented yet)
#pid_path=/var/run/snort_eth0.pid

[configuration]

# Enable / Disable rules based on the level of functionality/security you want.
# must be one of: connectivity, balanced, security, max-detect, none
# default is connectivity. Will not work with community ruleset.

# Rule Output mode:
# simple (just a single .rules file, with any rule that's not commented out enabled)
# policy (rules file with all rules enabled, using a policy file to enable/disable rules)
rule_mode = simple

# policy path is reqiured if you are using rule_mode = policy
# policy_path = c:\snort\rules\pulledpork.policy

# where to save our single combined rule file (This is required, and needs to be an absolute path):
rule_path = /usr/local/etc/rules/pulledpork.rules

# PulledPork will use the system default temporary working directory, unless you specify a different one below.

# temp location. This is useful during troubleshooting PulledPork3 with the -k (keep temp directory) flag
